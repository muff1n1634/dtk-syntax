# Syntax definitions for [decomp-toolkit](https://github.com/encounter/decomp-toolkit) formats

## Supported formats
- `splits.txt`
- `symbols.txt`

## Supported platforms and installation
### [Sublime Text 4](https://sublimetext.com)

Copy the `sublime/` folder into your `Packages/User` folder. (Maybe also rename it to something like `dtk-syntax/` so you don't get confused.) Syntax highlighting should be available after reloading `splits.txt` and `symbols.txt`. The syntax should also be available in the Command Palette (try searching "`syntax dtk`").

### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Coming soon
